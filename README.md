# presentation
Created for AIC 2017 Internal Conference by WWT Asynchrony Labs.

Static presentation materials found under /presentation folder using
reveal.js to be web acessible.  Presentation meterials are design to be
__presented__ so much of the content is in speaker notes or my head.

## pick-the-icon example app
A simple sample website used in the presentation as an example of a site
needing load testing as well as how different users (agents) operate on
tasks without shared state.

"pick" by Andr√© Luiz Gollo from the Noun Project

## Whoppex
The basic load testing built using Elixir as the basis for learning and
this talk.  Designed to be extensible and simple to model agent
behaviors and create large quantities of agents for performance and load
testing.  Available as [Hex library](https://hex.pm/packages/whoppex) as well as used as a pre-built
binary.
